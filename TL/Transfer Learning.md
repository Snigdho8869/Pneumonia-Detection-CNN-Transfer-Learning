Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point to solve a new, related task. The idea behind transfer learning is that the knowledge learned by a model from one task can be useful for another related task. By using transfer learning, we can save time and computational resources by reusing pre-trained models instead of training a new model from scratch.

In transfer learning, the pre-trained model is typically a deep neural network that has been trained on a large dataset for a specific task, such as image classification. The pre-trained model is then adapted to a new task by replacing the final layers of the model with new layers that are specific to the new task. These new layers are then trained on a smaller dataset for the new task.

Transfer learning has been successfully applied to many different tasks, including image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition. By leveraging transfer learning, researchers and developers can achieve state-of-the-art performance on new tasks with significantly less training data and computational resources.
