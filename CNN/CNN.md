CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network. It is a type of deep learning neural network that is commonly used in image recognition and computer vision tasks. The main characteristic of a CNN is that it uses convolutional layers to extract features from the input images, followed by pooling layers to reduce the spatial size of the features, and then fully connected layers to classify the images based on the extracted features.

Convolutional layers work by applying a set of filters to the input image, which convolve over the image to produce feature maps. The filters learn to recognize patterns and features in the input image. Pooling layers are used to downsample the feature maps and reduce their spatial size, while keeping the most important features. Finally, fully connected layers are used to classify the image based on the extracted features.
